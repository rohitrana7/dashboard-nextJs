# NextJs and ReactJs (https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/rendering-ui)

## Chapter 1
Next.js is a React framework.
By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

You can use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching, and caching - all while improving the developer and end-user experience.

You can use React and Next.js to build fully interactive, highly dynamic, and performant web applications.

## Chapter 3

imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï

Writing code in plain javascript is imperative programming

React is a popular declarative library that you can use build user interfaces.

As a developer, you can tell React what you want to happen to the user interface, and React will figure out the steps of how to update the DOM on your behalf.
